Leader in the country's $40 billion intra-city logistics market, Porter strives to improve the lives of 1,50,000+ driver-partners by providing them with consistent earning & independence. Currently, the company has serviced 5+ million customers

Porter works with a wide range of restaurants for delivering their items directly to the people.

Porter has a number of delivery partners available for delivering the food, from various restaurants and wants to get an estimated delivery time that it can provide the customers on the basis of what they are ordering, from where and also the delivery partners.

This dataset has the required data to train a regression model that will do the delivery time estimation, based on all those features.

## Concepts Used:
Basic Neural Network Model

## Approach:
- Performed Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis.
- Performed Feature engineering , missing value imputation, outlier removal and standardization.
- Applied Neural Network sequential model as a regressor to predict the delivery estimation time.

## Business Insights 
- Friday and Wednesday have the lowest average delivery time taken.
- Saturday has the highest average outstanding orders.
- Saturday has the highest average number of busy and onshift partners.
- At 8:00 AM it takes the highest average delivery time.
- At 2:00 AM outstanding orders have the highest average outstanding orders and average busy and onshift partners.
- Order protocol 5 has the highest number of average onshift partners ,average busy partners and average outstanding orders.
- On monday at 6:00 AM we have the lowest average delivery time

## Recommendations
- Porter should come up with strategies that effeciently divides the onshift partners to reduce the delivery time.
- Porter should do more research on reducing the order protocols delivery time.
- Porter should focus more on product categories that have less number of orders.
